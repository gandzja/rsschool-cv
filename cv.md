### Code example:

**Friend or Foe? from CODEWARS:** _Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it._
_If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not..._
_Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]_

```
function friend(friends){
  return friends.filter(n => n.length === 4)
}
```
